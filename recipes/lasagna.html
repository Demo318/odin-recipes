  <h2>A classic favorite of all pasta lovers.</h2>
  <p>Tell me, what's better than a cat? What's better cat is there than Garfield? What better food is there than Garfield's favorite food? That's right! Lasagna.</p>
  <p>This dish is so full of seed oils, it will trick you into eating every last bit of it regardless of the calorie content. The meat is completely optional because, as you know, the purpose of lasagna is only to carb overload before the big sporting competition tomorrow.</p>
